# The EU accession anchor and party-political competition: democratic backsliding and Turkish EU membership discourses in Parliament

Baysan,A. & Ozdemir, S. (under-review), Mediterrenean Politics. 

## Abstract:

Democracy in the Mediterranean EU candidate countries has considerably deteriorated
in recent years. This article draws on the Turkish case to assess how democratic
backsliding affects parliamentary EU membership discourses. In response to the governing
AKP‘s authoritarian turn, we attest increasing support for EU membership
among opposition parties that are not allied with the incumbent. We also find that
the predominant framing of Turkey‘s EU membership in the Turkish Parliament
shifted from normative to utilitarian arguments, emphasizing cost-benefit considerations
instead of liberal democratic values. Since parties‘ ideological predispositions
remained relatively stable over the period under study, we pinpoint governmentopposition
dynamics as the primary mechanism explaining changing party positions
and frames on EU membership. The article concludes with an outlook and a discussion
of implications beyond the Turkish case
